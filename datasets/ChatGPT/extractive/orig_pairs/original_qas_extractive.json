A large cut of meat or whole poultry should be divided into smaller pieces or placed in shallow containers before refrigerating.\n\nPlacement of Foods\n\nShelves\nShelves should be adjustable to accommodate a variety of packages.\n\nSpecialized compartment (applicable models only)\nSealed crisper drawers provide an optimal storage environment for fruits and vegetables. Vegetables require higher humidity conditions while fruits require lower humidity conditions. Crispers are equipped with controls devices to control the humidity level. (*Depending on model and options) An adjustable temperature meat drawer maximizes the storage time of meats and cheeses.\n\nStored on the door\nDon’t store perishable foods in the door. Eggs should be stored in the carton on a shelf. The temperature of the storage bins in the door fluctuates more than the temperature in the cabinet. Keep the door closed as much as possible.\n\nFreezer Compartment\nYou can store frozen food, make ice cubes and freeze fresh food in the freezer compartment.\n\nNOTE\nFreeze fresh, undamaged food only. Keep food which is to be frozen away from food which is already frozen. To prevent food from losing its flavour or drying out, place in airtight containers.\n\nRefrigerator & Freezer Storage Chart\nThe freshness longevity depends on temperature and exposure to moisture.
