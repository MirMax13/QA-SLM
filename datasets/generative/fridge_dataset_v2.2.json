    "response": "The door-opening frequency of a refrigerator can be affected by various factors such as the number of people in the household, their habits, and the types of food being stored. For example, if there is a large family or multiple people frequently accessing the refrigerator for snacks, the door may be opened more often, which could lead to increased energy consumption and reduced cooling performance. To optimize the efficiency of the refrigerator, it's essential to minimize door-opening frequency by organizing food storage and promoting mindful usage habits.",
