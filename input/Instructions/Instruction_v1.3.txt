How to store for best preservation (applicable models only)
Cover foods to retain moisture and prevent them from picking up odors from other foods. A large pot of food like soup or stew should be divided 
into small portions and put in shallow containers before being refrigerated. A large cut of meat or whole poultry should be divided into smaller 
pieces or placed in shallow containers before refrigerating.

Placement of Food
Shelves
Shelves should be adjustable to accommodate a variety of packages.
Specialized compartment
(applicable models only)
Sealed crisper drawers provide an optimal storage environment for fruits and vegetables. 
Vegetables require higher humidity conditions while fruits require lower humidity conditions.
Crispers are equipped with controls devices to control the humidity level. (*Depending on model 
and options) An adjustable temperature meat drawer maximizes the storage time of meats and 
cheeses.
