For more details on grounding, inquire at the Samsung Electronics service centre.\\n• This appliance is equipped with a power cord having an equipment-grounding conductor and a grounding power plug. The power plug must be plugged into an appropriate outlet socket that is installed and grounded in accordance with all local codes and ordinances.\\n• Never start up an appliance showing any signs of damage. If in doubt, consult your dealer.\\n• Do not plug the appliance into a multi-socket adapter which does not have a power cable (mounted).\\n• The appliance should be connected to a dedicated power line which is separately fused.\\n• Do not use a multi-socket outlet which is not properly grounded (portable). In case of using a properly-grounded multi-socket (portable), use the multi-socket outlet with the current capacity of the power cord rating or higher and use the multi-socket outlet only for the appliance.\\n• Dispose of all packaging materials (such as plastic bags and styrofoam) away from children. The packaging materials can cause suffocation.\\nOperation\\n⚠ CAUTION\\nTo reduce the risk of minor injury to persons, malfunction, or damage to the product or property when using this product, follow basic precaution, including the following:\\n• Be careful of nearby children when you open or close the appliance door, The door may bump the child and cause injury.\\n• Avoid the danger of children getting trapped inside the appliance. A child trapped inside the appliance can cause suffocation. Do not touch frozen food or the metal parts in the freezer compartment with wet or damp hands. It may cause frostbite.\\n• Do not place glass containers, bottles or cans (especially those containing carbonated drinks) in the freezer compartment, shelves or ice bin that will be exposed to temperatures below freezing.\\n• The tempered glass on the front side of the appliance door or the shelves can be damaged by an impact. If it is broken. Do not touch it with hands.\\n• Do not hang from the appliance doors, storage room, shelf or climb up into it.\\n• Do not store an excessive amount of water bottles or containers for side dishes on the door baskets.\\n• Do not open or close the appliance door with excessive force.\\n• If the hinge of the appliance door is damaged or operates improperly, stop using the appliance and contact an authorized service centre.\\n• Prevent animals from nibbling on the power cable or water hose.\\n• Never eat frozen foods immediately after they have been taken out in the freezer compartment.\\n• Make sure not to get a hand or foot stuck upon opening or closing the appliance door or door in door.\\nMaintenance\\n• Do not clean glass shelves or covers with warm water when they are cold. They may shatter if exposed to sudden temperature changes.\\n• Do not insert the shelves upside down.
